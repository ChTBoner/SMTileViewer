# SMTileViewer
A lightweight real time TileViewer for Super Metroid using usb2snes ws protocol

#Usage 

You can add a scale argument to launch it like `SMTileViewer 2.0` this will not look especially good since SDL2 is not mean to do that :)

#Build

You need the rust environment and follow the SDL2 crate documentation to be able to run it/build.
